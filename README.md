#Project Overview
This repository contains code files and resources for a computer vision project aimed at developing and deploying segmentation of models. 
Below is a brief description of the directory structure and instructions for running the deployment and modeling codes.

Requirements
To run the deployment and modeling codes, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

pip install streamlit matplotlib opencv-python numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn


Additionally, make sure you are using Tensorflow version 2.12 and Python 3.11.4.

Running the Deployment
To run the deployment, execute the following command in your terminal:

streamlit run deployment.py

This command will start a Streamlit web application where you can interact with the deployed model.

Important Note
Please ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly and the specified versions of Python and Tensorflow are being used to avoid any compatibility issues.
